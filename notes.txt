  The last paragraph has this:

Remember GTK+? Some developers got the crazy idea that it was a great
toolkit and should be used in everything. And we can create a desktop
based on the toolkit. Like many crazy ideas, this is becoming a
reality. The GNOME project is well underway, in the alpha stages. The
GNOME project is being aggressively supported by Red Hat Labs. All of
this may be seen as a byproduct of GIMP. The success of this one
project has spawned many.

* Sumana says:

<sumanah> Here's the question: who's it for?
<sumanah> Rhetorical triangle: audience, message, and medium.
<sumanah> I think it should be for the community of people who make GNOME, widely construed
<sumanah> users -- users will want, like, a blog post or a "thank you"
msg or something
<sumanah> downstreams and upstreams, OEMs, etc., get a different thankyou etc
<sumanah> but the people who make GNOME, code, translations,
organizers, etc., "this is your story"
<sumanah> a sort of family scrapbook, or like a school yearbook
<sumanah> have an overarching chronological narrative -- sections --
and then within those sections have smaller "sidebar" sections about
people, local communities, efforts
<sumanah> As for reaching out to old contributors, if you tell them
you want to interview them so you can honor their place in GNOME's
heritage in an upcoming anniversary project, that might work
